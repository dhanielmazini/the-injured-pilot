  storyText: "Okay, you're around the corner. No one can see you. You think. \n\nBit
    tough to hear yourself think above the thumping machinery. However, in front
    of\r you is the emergency exit door. It has an oversized, cast iron lock hanging
    from a bolted handle. You could try picking the lock, or maybe look for a way
    to pry\r it off.\n\nWhat to do?\n1. Pick it.\n2. Pry it."
